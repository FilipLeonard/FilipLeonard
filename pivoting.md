# Pivoting Journey

I started working as an [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) developer on the 1st of March 2018, during my junior year in [cs university](https://cs.upt.ro/). I slowly began to grow out of the ABAP world, I got tired of it, I wasn't doing nearly as much coding as I wanted and couldn't find the motivation to dig deeply into that ERP world, and to grasp the whole ecosystem. Meanwhile, I was often thinking at [this Angular course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) I almost finished during senior year, but never thinking too serious, since that momentarily acquired knowledge didn't really find a home into my long-term memory. Angular fuzzed out in my mind, I was writing ABAP and reading business, often finance-related, functional specs and information.

Fast-forward 2020, our senior team lead / coach started to bring about into meetings the development of a light web dashboard for one of the regularly used ABAP-based tools, so I offered to take that task. It included an OData Service on the on-prem SAP System, to provide the data, and a [UI5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenUI5) app running in the browser to consume it. Several weeks into it and full time into UI5, I was reading API Reference and Samples all day and kept adding incremental functionality to the small app. I liked it, even though we were following a freestyle development approach and crossing out todos during shortened pseudo-sprints. I liked JavaScript and even Eclipse felt such an improvement over the ABAP Workbench. So, after sleeping a lot on it, I finally decided to close my remaining tasks and go into a 5-month web development learning sabbatical.

1st of November 2020 was the first day. Below, I'll keep track of the larger resources I dived into:
